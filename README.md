I think one of the most liked Python project would be, implementation of the classical problem called "Missionaries and Cannibals". The objective is to transport a group of three missionaries and three cannibals across a river using a boat, in such a way that at no point on either river bank, are there more cannibals than missionaries, because if there are, the cannibals eat the missionaries. This game illustrates problem-solving, search algorithms (such as BFS, DFS, or even A*), and AI logic. It provides graphical interface to visualize the boat movement and trail.
