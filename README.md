## 🧩 Problem Statement

The goal is to transport **3 missionaries** and **3 cannibals** across a river using a boat that can carry at most **two people**. The rules are:

- If **cannibals outnumber missionaries** on either bank, **missionaries get eaten**.
- The boat **cannot cross the river empty**.
- Only **1 or 2 people** can be on the boat at once.

The challenge is to **find a safe sequence of moves** to get everyone across without violating any rules.
